# Simple Terminal Pong Game

This is a simple pong game that runs with crossterm written in Rust. It has
almost no features, it's just the gameplay loop with awful ball physics, and
that's it.

Control the left paddle with <kbd>W</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd>, and the right paddle
with <kbd>I</kbd> and <kbd>K</kbd>.
